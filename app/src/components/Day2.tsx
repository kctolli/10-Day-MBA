                    <p>
                    Relativism proposes that ethics are “relative” to the personal, social, and cultural circumstances
                    in which one finds oneself.

                    <li>Naive relativism holds that every person has his or her own standard that enables him or her to make choices.</li>

                    <li>Social relativism is akin to naive relativism - People refer to social norms to render ethical judgments.</li>
